This app appears to be a movie recommendation app that interacts with The Movie Database (TMDB) API to provide users with the following functionality:
Genre Selection:
The app fetches a list of available movie genres from TMDB and populates a dropdown menu. Users can select a genre from this dropdown to filter movies by their preferred type (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).
Random Movie Display:
After selecting a genre, users can click the "Play" button to display information about a randomly selected movie from that genre. This includes:
The movie's poster image.
The movie's title.
A brief overview or description of the movie.
Like/Dislike Movies:
Once a random movie is displayed, users can interact with "Like" or "Dislike" buttons. Clicking either button clears the current movie from the screen and fetches another random movie for display.
Dynamic UI Updates:
The app dynamically updates the webpage using JavaScript and DOM manipulation:
It clears previously displayed movies when new ones are fetched.
It shows or hides buttons and elements based on user interactions.
It creates and displays HTML elements for movie details such as posters, titles, and overviews.
